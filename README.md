## Background

"We've developed a security software named Ashil and a vulnerable program named Delta, inspired by the following story: Ashil, the lovable 11-year-old German Shepherd, passed away due to a heart attack just a month before his 11th birthday. He adored Delta, and on his final day, he strived to share all his food with Delta. The memory of Ashil will forever remain in our hearts."
